# Werkstudent Solved Python Task by JEELKUMAR LANGALIA
Tools used: Git, GitHub, VS Code

## Overview of the Task
This project is part of the Werkstudent Python interview task. The objective is to process data from sample invoices by:

Extracting specific details such as dates and amounts.
Generating an Excel file with two sheets:
Sheet 1: Contains raw extracted data.
Sheet 2: Includes a summary pivot table.
Creating a CSV file with the extracted data.
Providing an executable file makes the program easy to run, even without installing Python.


## How It Works

### Data Extraction

The executable file is too large for GitHub. You can download it here:
[Download script.exe](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DQlo_vadCjdLhMUCDnRx4fbEXMj_VRsO?usp=drive_link)

The script extracts the following details from the sample invoices:
1. **Invoice 1**:
   - **Date**: `2024-03-01`
   - **Value**: `381.12 â‚¬`
2. **Invoice 2**:
   - **Date**: `2016-11-26`
   - **Value**: `USD $950.00`

### Excel File Creation
- **Sheet 1**: Contains columns:
  - File Name
  - Date
  - Value
- **Sheet 2**: A pivot table summarizing:
  - Total value by date and document name.

### CSV File Creation
The CSV file mirrors the data in **Sheet 1**, separated by semicolons (`;`).


## Running the Code

### Option 1: Using the Executable File
1. Place the following files in the same folder as `script.exe`:
   - `sample_invoice_1.pdf`
   - `sample_invoice_2.pdf`
2. Double-click `script.exe` to execute the program.
3. The output files will be generated in the same folder:
   - `invoices_summary.xlsx`
   - `invoices_summary.csv`

### Option 2: Running the Python Script
1. Install Python and required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl PyPDF2
